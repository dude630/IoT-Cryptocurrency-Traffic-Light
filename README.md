# IoT-Cryptocurrency-Traffic-Light
A traffic light that shows the trends of Bitcoin using the CoinGecko API and a NodeMcu (ESP8266) microcontroller

This project uses three LEDs to show the 24hr change direction and flash every minute the direction the price has gone within that time.

# Libraries
This sketch uses the ArduinoJson v5.13.4 and the most recent ESP8266 board libraries.
